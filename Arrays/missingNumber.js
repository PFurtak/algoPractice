Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

Example 1:

Input: [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Note:
Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant extra space complexity?

// input is an array
// output is a single integer of the missing number in the array
// going to need a function that takes in an array (inputArray)
// O(n) time complexity is required, meaning no nested loops
// I think a good approach would be to sort in ascending order, then loop through the inputArray and compare indices to find the missing number
// create a variable for the missing number with value of null

// My first solution... breaks on testcondition with a single integer in the array

let missingNumber = function (inputArray) {

  for (let i = 0; i < inputArray.length - 1; i++) {
